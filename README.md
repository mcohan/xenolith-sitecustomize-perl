xenolith-sitecustomize-perl
===========================

Many Perls are built to support $PROOT/site/lib/sitecustomize.pl - this is how I do my sitecustomize.pl

In the Perl documentation set, it might be mentioned once in perlvar
and once in perlrun. Thanks to M. G. Schwern for that; see

   http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2007/10/msg129926.html

The "-f" switch when running perl will one-time-disable use of
sitecustomize.pl. In fact, when developing the script-library,
running with this switch is often necessary for testing as you
procede.

I run this on StrawberryPerl on M$Windoes (7) and Your Mileage May
Vary.

This repo exists primarily for my own future self to check what I did
"way back when" and explain things to myself.
